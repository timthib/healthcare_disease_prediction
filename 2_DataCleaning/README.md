# Data Science Exploration Curriculum

This folder contains the step-by-step exercises to master Data Exploration.

## 1. Visualization Basics (`01_visualize_trends.py`)
*(Already present)* - Simple line plots to see trends over time.

## 2. Data Engineering (`02_create_master_dataset.py`)
**CURRENT TASK**: Real-world data is scattered. Your job is to standardise and merge disparate data sources (WHO & World Bank) into a single "Source of Truth".

## 3. Missing Value Analysis (`03_missing_values.py`)
*Coming soon* - Once we have the Master Dataset, we'll see it's full of holes (NaNs). We will visualize these gaps to decide if we drop rows, fill them (impute), or cry.

## 4. Correlation & Multivariate Analysis (`04_correlations.py`)
*Coming soon* - We will look for the "Why". Does GDP correlate with Mortality? Does Vaccination rate correlate with Life Expectancy?
